Passwords for multiple accounts on the same domain can be saved but one account on a particular domain can only contain one password.
For example: The domain "Netflix" can have multiple users like "User1" and "User2" but each user can have one password only. Adding multiple passwords to the same user on the same domain will update the existing password to the last password entered.

No input should contain spaces.
For example: "User 1" should be entered as "User1" or "User_1".
