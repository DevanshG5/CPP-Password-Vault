# CPP-Pass-Manager
This is a simple password manager application written in C++. It saves the passwords locally. This program is still under development.
The program can add, view, and search for specific passwords.
It uses a 2 dimensional map to store the data.
The data is stored in the following format, "Domain Name : User :: Password".
The data is stored in plain text format.

Upcoming features: 1. Entry deletion functionality. 2. Storage of data in an encrypted format instead of plain text.
Any and all suggestions are most welcome.
